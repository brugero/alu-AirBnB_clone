AirBnB_clone
Project Description
This project is the first step in building a full-fledged web application, an AirBnB clone. It focuses on creating a backend command interpreter to manage the objects of the application, such as User, State, City, and Place.

The command interpreter, console.py, serves as the core of this project. It provides a simple, interactive command-line interface to create, retrieve, update, and destroy objects. This project lays the foundational understanding of:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a BaseModel parent class.

Unit Testing with the unittest module.

Command-line interfaces using Python's cmd module.

The Command Interpreter

How to Start It
To start the command interpreter in interactive mode, run the console.py script from your terminal:

$ ./console.py

The interpreter will start and display the prompt (hbnb).
